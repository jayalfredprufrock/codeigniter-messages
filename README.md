codeigniter-messages
====================

A CI spark for handling flash messages gracefully.

##Composer installation
If  using composer to include this spark, note that [composer/installers](https://github.com/composer/installers) is used to place the spark within `application/modules` so you'll either need to override this location, or change your default spark location.
